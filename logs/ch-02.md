## Skills Required for Implementation

The following skills would be needed to implement the MicroSims:

1. **microsim-generator** - For all 10 interactive elements
2. Standard p5.js implementations using canvas-based controls

## Content Highlights

### Humor Elements Added

- "Resistance is futile" pun in introduction
- Reference to disappointing shock from 9V battery
- "Bad Beer Rots Our Young Guts But Vodka Goes Well" mnemonic for color codes
- "resistance isn't futile—it's measured in ohms" closing line
- Various lighthearted explanations throughout

### Key Pedagogical Features

- Progressive complexity (simple to complex concepts)
- Concrete examples before abstract principles
- Worked example with complete solution (series-parallel analysis)
- Self-check questions at end
- Key formulas summary table
- Practical wisdom section with real-world tips

## Notes

- Content follows college reading level guidelines (18-25 word sentences, technical vocabulary with definitions)
- All equations follow the math-equations.md format (level 4 header, equation, where clause)
- MicroSim specifications include Bloom taxonomy levels and instructional rationale
- Chapter maintains the "superpower" theme throughout
