## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 7 | 50% |
| Apply (L3) | 4 | 29% |
| Analyze (L4) | 3 | 21% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution emphasizes Understand and Apply levels, appropriate for introducing new analysis methods and building conceptual foundations before deeper analysis in later chapters.
