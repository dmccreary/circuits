## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 3 | 37.5% |
| Apply (L3) | 3 | 37.5% |
| Analyze (L4) | 2 | 25% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution balances Understand and Apply levels, appropriate for introducing phasor techniques while emphasizing problem-solving application.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 8 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `phasor-transform` - Sinusoid to phasor transformation
2. `phasor-addition` - Vector addition of phasors
3. `reactance-frequency` - XL and XC vs frequency curves
4. `impedance-triangle` - R, X, Z relationship
5. `phasor-circuit-solver` - Step-through series RLC analysis
6. `resonance-comparison` - Series vs parallel resonance
7. `bandwidth-selectivity` - Q and bandwidth visualization

## Writing Style Notes

The content follows the requested style:

- **Light and humorous tone**: "Freezing the Dance" introduction, "tank" circuit nickname
- **Superpower theme**: Phasors as "one of the most powerful tools in circuit analysis"
- **Critical thinking emphasis**: When to use Z vs Y, series vs parallel resonance applications
- **Calculus-aware**: Differentiation → multiplication by jω transformation
- **College level vocabulary**: Technical terms introduced systematically
- **Engineering wisdom**: Voltage magnification warnings, practical Q factor implications

## Dependencies for Full Functionality

To render all content properly:

1. **MkDocs Material** with:
   - admonition extension
   - pymdownx.details extension (for collapsible sections)

2. **MathJax/KaTeX** for equation rendering

3. **8 MicroSims** to be implemented in `docs/sims/` directory
