## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 4 | 44% |
| Apply (L3) | 3 | 33% |
| Analyze (L4) | 3 | 33% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution emphasizes Understand and Apply levels with significant Analyze content, appropriate for building on transient analysis foundations while introducing the more complex second-order behavior.
