## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 1 | 50% |
| Apply (L3) | 0 | 0% |
| Analyze (L4) | 1 | 50% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

Balanced between Understand and Analyze levels.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 2 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `harmonic-explorer` - Harmonic synthesis step-through
2. `time-to-frequency` - Dual-domain visualization
