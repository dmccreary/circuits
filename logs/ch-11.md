## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 2 | 50% |
| Apply (L3) | 2 | 50% |
| Analyze (L4) | 0 | 0% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution balances Understand and Apply levels, appropriate for learning frequency response concepts and applying Bode plot techniques.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 4 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `frequency-response-viewer` - Magnitude and phase plots
2. `bode-plot-sketcher` - Asymptotic construction
3. `filter-type-comparison` - Four filter types
4. `filter-design-calc` - Component value calculator

---

## Writing Style Notes

The content follows the requested style:

- **Light and humorous tone**: "How Circuits Hear the World", musical instruments analogy
- **Superpower theme**: Bode analysis as a fundamental skill
- **Critical thinking emphasis**: Design trade-offs between filter types
- **Calculus-aware**: Transfer function mathematics, derivatives
- **College level vocabulary**: Technical terms with clear explanations
- **Engineering wisdom**: Butterworth vs Chebyshev trade-offs
