## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 2 | 50% |
| Apply (L3) | 2 | 50% |
| Analyze (L4) | 0 | 0% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution balances Understand and Apply levels, focusing on practical power calculations and understanding power relationships.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 4 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `instantaneous-power` - Power oscillation with phase angle
2. `power-triangle` - Interactive P, Q, S relationship
3. `pf-correction` - Capacitor sizing calculator
4. `power-flow-rlc` - Energy flow in R, L, C elements

---

## Writing Style Notes

The content follows the requested style:

- **Light and humorous tone**: "Where Does the Power Go?", "busy work" for reactive power
- **Superpower theme**: Understanding power is practical for real-world applications
- **Critical thinking emphasis**: Why PF matters economically, efficiency tradeoffs
- **Calculus-aware**: Instantaneous power derivation, integration for average
- **College level vocabulary**: Technical terms with clear unit definitions
- **Engineering wisdom**: Real-world efficiency values, factory PF penalties

---

## Dependencies for Full Functionality

To render all content properly:

1. **MkDocs Material** with:
   - admonition extension
   - pymdownx.details extension (for collapsible sections)

2. **MathJax/KaTeX** for equation rendering

3. **4 MicroSims** to be implemented in `docs/sims/` directory

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Generate MicroSims using microsim-generator skill
2. Review and adjust humor/tone if needed
3. Test all equations render correctly
4. Verify links to prerequisite chapters work
5. Consider adding glossary links for power terminology
