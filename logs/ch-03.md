## Instructional Design

**Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution:**

| Level | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Understand (L2) | 2 | KCL/KVL visualizations with step-through |
| Apply (L3) | 4 | Calculators, solvers with parameter exploration |
| Analyze (L4) | 3 | Topology explorer, comparisons, deconstruction |

**Pedagogical Approach:**

1. Started with KCL (simpler) before KVL
2. Built from laws → topology → systematic methods
3. Presented node voltage and mesh current as complementary approaches
4. Introduced special cases (supernode/supermesh) after standard techniques
5. Added decision guide for method selection
6. Culminated in matrix approach for scalability

**Tone Examples:**

- "If Ohm's Law gave you a single spell in your circuit wizard's toolkit, Kirchhoff's Laws give you the entire spellbook"
- "Gustav Kirchhoff (who published them in 1845 when he was just 21 years old—no pressure)"
- "Think of a mesh as a loop that's 'minimal'—you can't break it down into smaller loops. In a circuit with multiple meshes, each mesh is like a cell in a honeycomb."
- "You've graduated from 'hope and hunt' to 'systematic and certain'"
