## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 6 | 75% |
| Apply (L3) | 2 | 25% |
| Analyze (L4) | 0 | 0% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

The distribution heavily emphasizes Understand level, appropriate for introducing foundational concepts (complex numbers, sinusoidal parameters, signal classification) that students need to internalize before applying them in later chapters.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 8 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `sinusoid-anatomy` - Interactive sinusoidal parameter exploration
2. `phase-relationship` - Two-signal phase comparison with phasor diagram
3. `dc-ac-separator` - Component extraction visualization
4. `time-frequency-domain` - Dual-domain step-through
5. `complex-number-viz` - Complex plane with form conversions
6. `euler-circle` - Unit circle rotation animation
7. `gain-db-converter` - Linear gain to decibel converter

## Writing Style Notes

The content follows the requested style:

- **Light and humorous tone**: "Why the World Runs on Waves", "Your New Best Friend" (complex numbers), AC/DC "debate", electrons "shuffling like commuters"
- **Superpower theme**: Introduction frames AC knowledge as essential for understanding modern electrical systems
- **Critical thinking emphasis**: When to use rectangular vs polar form, choosing appropriate amplitude measures
- **Calculus-aware**: Derivatives of sinusoids, exponential form advantages
- **College level vocabulary**: Technical terms introduced systematically with definitions
- **Engineering wisdom**: Real-world frequencies (WiFi, audio), practical wall outlet example

## Dependencies for Full Functionality

To render all content properly:

1. **MkDocs Material** with:
   - admonition extension
   - pymdownx.details extension (for collapsible sections)

2. **MathJax/KaTeX** for equation rendering

3. **8 MicroSims** to be implemented in `docs/sims/` directory

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Generate MicroSims using microsim-generator skill
2. Review and adjust humor/tone if needed
3. Test all equations render correctly
4. Verify links to prerequisite chapters work
5. Consider adding glossary links for key terms (especially complex number terminology)
