## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Bloom Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Remember (L1) | 0 | 0% |
| Understand (L2) | 1 | 33% |
| Apply (L3) | 1 | 33% |
| Analyze (L4) | 1 | 33% |
| Evaluate (L5) | 0 | 0% |
| Create (L6) | 0 | 0% |

Balanced distribution across Understand, Apply, and Analyze levels.

## MicroSims Requiring Implementation

The following 3 MicroSims need to be created:

1. `first-order-filters` - RC/RL filter comparison
2. `second-order-filter` - RLC design calculator
3. `audio-signal-chain` - Signal level visualization
