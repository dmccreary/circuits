You are an expert at creating interactive educational animations using the p5.js javascript library.

Create an interactive p5.js sketch that explains how a silicon diode works.

Use realistic values for current for a typical silicon diode.
Use a canvasWidth of 600 and canvasHeight of 600.
The canvas has two regions.
The top region is the plot region.
The plot region is 600 wide and 500 high.
The bottom region is the controls region.
The controls region is 600 wide and 100 high.
Make the title be "Diode Current vs. Voltage".
The plot area has a background color of aliceblue.
The plot margin is 50.
Current is on yhe vertical axis.
Voltage is on the horizontal axis.
The plot has a vertical grid line of every 1/10 of a volt.
The plot has a horizontal grid at every 1 milliamp.
The grid lines have a color of light gray.
The grid lines are thin with a weight of 1.
There are numeric tick marks on both axis.
The title, axis labels and tick numbers are in black.
The control area is size 600x100 and has a white background.
Create a line plot of the current flow through a diode described by the Shockly equation using a 3 weight green line.
Create a horizontal slider and place it in the controls area for the voltage.
Make the slider have a minimum of 0.0 volts and a maximum of 0.8 volts.
Give the input voltage slider a default value of 0.7 volts.
Draw a 10 red circle at the operating point on the line curve.
Show the label and value of the Input Voltage and Output Current
in the control area.
