# Circuits Course Materials

Welcome to the website for an undergraduate course on
electronic circuits.  This course uses generative AI
and interactive
simulations to teach the theory and practice
of understanding and designing electronics circuits.

From our knowledge, this is one of the first circuits
course that assumes that all students have access
to a generative AI program such as ChatGPT.  We
provide an extensive library of [prompts](./prompts/index.md) to allow
students to generate their own experiments with
the help of generative AI.

Please contact me on [Dan McCreary LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/) if you have questions.
