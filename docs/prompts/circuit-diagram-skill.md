Please create a plan for using the /skill-creator skill to create a new skill that will
generate simple RLC circuit drawings on a simple grid layout for a Circuits 1 course. 
The name of the skill will be rlc-circuit-drawing-generator. 
On the left of the drawing will be a power source, which will be a battery, a DC power source
or an AC power source.  The power source will always be vertically oriented.
For a battery or DC power source the positive will be on the top.
On the right will be an arrangement of components: resistors, capacitors or inductors, a current meter or a voltage meter.  The components will be laid out on the grid in series, parallel or a combination
of series-parallel connections.
I want the specification to be a declarative file such as
