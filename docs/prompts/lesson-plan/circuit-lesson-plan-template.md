### Question 3: What is Ohm's Law?

Describe Ohm's Law.  What are the variables and how are they related?

??? note "Show answer"
    Ohm's Law is fundamental relationship stating that the voltage across a conductor equals the product of the current flowing through it and its resistance. The formula for Ohm's Law is: The formula is:

    $$
    V = IR
    $$

    Where:
    - $V$: Voltage
    - $I$: Current
    - $R$: Resistance
