# Top 100 Circuits from Claude

!!! prompt
    I am creating a new website that will be used as a teaching aid for a freshman one semester college-level level course about electrical engineering circuits. I need you to do detailed research to generate a list of the top 100 circuits that are most commonly used in a introductory circuits course. Please look for any sites that have list of circuits. We are focused mostly on analog circuits, not digital circuits. We want our students to be able to quickly visualize how these circuits work using both DC and AC input sources. 

    The list include only circuits typically covered in university-level textbooks (e.g., Thevenin/Norton equivalents, RC/RL filters, Op-Amp circuits), or also practical circuits used in labs (e.g., LED blinkers, audio amplifiers)?

    We are interested in a mix of both theoretical analysis circuits and hands-on practical circuits?

    Cast a wide net based on whatâ€™s commonly taught globally

    Note of a circuits is also used in specific curriculum standards (e.g., IEEE, ABET accredited syllabi)

    Feel free to include variations of similar circuit types (e.g., low-pass vs. high-pass filters) or only distinct circuit functions

    Always place two newliness before a markdown list. 

    For each of the 100 circuit, please return the following format. 

### Circuit Name
