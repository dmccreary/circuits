# Concept Taxonomy

## Prompt

```
Let's Create a taxonomy to classify these concepts. For the list of concepts, can you suggest a taxonomy of up to ten categories on how to classify each concept? For example: 1. Foundational Concept (Physics, Math, Solid-State Physics) 2. Discrete Device (Resistor, Capacitor, Transistor) 3. Measurement (Voltage, Current, Power) 4. Analysis Technique (Bode Plot, Nodal Analysis) 5. Functional Circuit (Comparater, Low Pass Filter) What would your list of categories be? What are examples of concepts within each category?
