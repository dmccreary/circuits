# Concept Enumeration

## Prompt

```
I am helping teach an undergraduate course on circuits at
a local university. I would like to understand the key
concepts that need to be presented in this course and
the order in which they should be taught.

Please create a list of the 100 most essential concepts
in an undergraduate circuits course. For each concept,
just return the concept name.
Make sure that the concepts are distinct and not related.

Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then
proceed to the most complex concepts. Return the list
without any numbers, just one concept per line.
Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations.
