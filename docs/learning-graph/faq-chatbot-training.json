      "answer": "Passive filters use only resistors, capacitors, and inductors. They cannot amplify signals, and their performance can be affected by loading. Active filters include op-amps and can provide gain, better isolation, and sharper cutoffs without inductors. Active filters are preferred in most audio applications.",
