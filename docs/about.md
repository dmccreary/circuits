# About the Generative AI Circuits Course

Let's face it.  Static textbooks are obsolete.

We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded
in all our tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can
take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.

This course will make a new set of assumptions:

1. All teachers and students have access to LLM tools like ChatGPT.
2. With the right templates, these tools can create powerful interactive simulations.
3. There are some questions that get answered frequently.  We focus on
high-quality material for these frequently-asked questions.  This
is our [Parato Analysis](./glossary.md#pareto-analysis) method.  We can use [Google Analytics]
3. The circuits course is a collection of Concepts that have dependencies.  This
concept structure can be stored in a knowledge graph.
