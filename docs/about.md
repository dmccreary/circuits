# About the Generative AI Circuits Course

Let's face it.  Static textbooks are obsolete.

We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded
in all our tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can
take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.

The key skill we teach is how is to be able to provide precise [prompts](./glossary.md#llm-prompt) to [large-language models](./glossary.md#large-lang) (LLMs) to quickly customize your learning journey.

This course will make a new set of assumptions:

1. All teachers and students have access to LLM tools like ChatGPT so they
can quickly customize a lesson, a simulation or a diagram.
2. With the right prompt templates, these LLM tools can create powerful interactive simulations.
3. There are some questions that get answered frequently.  We focus on
high-quality material for these frequently-asked questions.  This
is our [Parato Analysis](./glossary.md#pareto-analysis) method.  We can use [Google Analytics]
4. The circuits course is a collection of [Concepts](./glossary.md#knowledge-graph-concept) that have dependencies.  This
concept structure can be stored in a knowledge graph.  We can traverse this knowledge graph to create precise hallucination-free responses to [frequently asked questions](./glossary.md#frequently-asked-question).
5. Many concepts are similar.  We can use LLMs and embeddings to find the similarity in questions, answers, concepts, devices, simulations, assessments and diagrams.  Allowing stakeholders to quickly find similar items using a [vector store](./glossary.md#vector-store) is critical to providing a high-quality experience for our stakeholders.

## Building the Foundation for Hyperpersonalized Learning

Our goal is to eventually use [hyperpersonalization](./glossary.md#hyperpersonalization) to generate custom lesson plans and simulations based on the needs of each of our stakeholders.
