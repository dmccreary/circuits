# About the Generative AI Circuits Course

Let's face it.  Static textbooks are obsolete.  Learning with hands-on
interactive simulations is a lot more fun and effective.
In the past, creating these simulations was a slow and expensive process.  Generative AI has changed this.

Generative AI make it easy to create a new simulation of a circuit. It also makes it easy to customize every example and to ask questions about how to analyze a circuit.

We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded
in all our circuit design and simulation tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.

The key skill we teach is how is to be able to provide precise [prompts](./glossary.md#llm-prompt) to [large-language models](./glossary.md#large-language-model) (LLMs) to quickly customize your learning journey.

## Our New Assumptions

This course will make a new set of assumptions:

### 1. Universal Access

All teachers and students have access to LLM tools like ChatGPT so they
can quickly customize a lesson, a simulation or a diagram.

### 2. Prompt Engineering

With the right prompt templates, these LLM tools can create powerful interactive simulations.  Our assumption is that students that have strong prompt engineering skills will be better positions to work with AI agents to solve complex problems.

### 3. Metaphors and Stories

Although many students have a strong math background, some students
have difficulty getting an intuitive sense of a circuit from an equation.
Fear not!  Generative AI is excellent at finding [metaphors and stores](./glossary.md#metaphors-and-stories)
to quickly allow all students to gain rapid understanding of complex concepts.
Using high-quality metaphors and stories makes circuits accessible to a larger
population of students that are at different stages of their math journey.

Here is a suggested prompt for generating [metaphors and stories](./prompts/metaphors-and-stories.md).  I encourage everyone, both instructors and students to use generative AI to generate non-technical explanations without over dependance on complex mathematical formulas.

### 4. FAQ Analytics

There are some questions that get answered frequently.  Experienced
instructors know this and have developed great tools to
give students clear answers to important foundational concepts.

However, newer instructors my not have a sense of what key
concepts need to be understood and in what order they should be explained.
They also don't have a deep understanding of why having an intuitive
understanding of key concepts is so essential.  They also
have developed ways of listening to students and asking clarifying
questions to uncover where the lack of foundational concept understanding lies.

Here is where generative AI can help.  Large-language foundation models
are trained not
ust on a single textbook, but they have learned from literally billions of source documents.  They have a sense of the order these concepts should be taught
and the techniques use to teach them.

In this course focus on high-quality material for these frequently-asked questions.  This
is our [Parato Analysis](./glossary.md#pareto-analysis) method.  We can use [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) to gather data on 
which pages are being used the most and we can use feedback forms
to quickly gather feedback when concepts are not clear.

### 5. Concept Graphs

All circuits courses are based on learning a collection of [Concepts](./glossary.md#knowledge-graph-concept) that have dependencies on other concepts.  This
concept structure can be stored in a knowledge graph.  We can traverse this knowledge graph to create precise hallucination-free responses to [frequently asked questions](./glossary.md#frequently-asked-question).

### 6. Similarity

Many concepts are similar.  We can use LLMs and embeddings to find the similarity in questions, answers, concepts, devices, simulations, assessments and diagrams.  Allowing stakeholders to quickly find similar items using a [vector store](./glossary.md#vector-store) is critical to providing a high-quality experience for our stakeholders.

## Building the Foundation for Hyperpersonalized Learning

Our goal is to eventually use [hyperpersonalization](./glossary.md#hyperpersonalization) to generate custom lesson plans and simulations based on the needs of each of our stakeholders.  These tools can be directly
integrated with a [graph-based learning management system](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-lms/)
to provide low-cost but high-quality eduction for everyone.

## Prerequisites

Because our lesson plans can be customized with generative AI, we have
a much more limited set of required math prerequisites.  Our generative AI
prompts use a variety of metaphors a storytelling to help students gain
an intuitive understanding of how circuits work.

On the other hand, students that already have a strong understanding
of mathematics including calculus can have their lesson plans tuned
to their background.

## Related MicroSites

Building open-source training material with microsites can be fun.  In
the past I have often built a custom microsite for a single one-hour
presentation.  Here are some related microsites:

[Beginning Electronics](https://dmccreary.github.io/beginning-electronics/) - targeting a younger audience with fun but simple hands-on breadboard projects. THis course does not assume any math background.

[Digital Electronics](https://dmccreary.github.io/digital-electronics/) - this site uses the same generative AI approach but it puts a focus on hands-on labs for
younger students and simulations of simple digital systems.  The focus is generating simple labs and simulations using low-cost breadboards and LEDs.

[MicroSims](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/) - our original site
that contains generative AI generated simulations.

[Robot Day](https://dmccreary.github.io/robot-day/) - a single day of fun activities for students that want to learn about how robots work.

[MicroPython](https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/) - Mostly projects that
use the Raspberry Pi micro-controller to gather sensor data and update displays.
