# Circuits 1

**Title:** Circuits 1
**Audience:** College students majoring in electrical engineering or computer science
**Credits:** 4 (3 lecture hours, 3 laboratory hours per week)

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to analog electrical systems with particular emphasis on audio circuits and signals. Students explore the fundamental principles governing electrical circuit behavior through both theoretical analysis and hands-on laboratory experimentation.

The course bridges mathematical foundations with practical applications, using audio systems as a unifying theme. Students learn to analyze circuits in both time and frequency domains, developing intuition for how components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors shape electrical signals. The operational amplifier (op-amp) serves as a gateway to active circuit design, enabling students to build functional audio processing circuits.

Laboratory work reinforces theoretical concepts through construction and measurement of real circuits. Students gain proficiency with oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers while building audio amplifiers, filters, and signal processing circuits.
