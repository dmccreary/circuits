## List of Terms Used in Circuit Course

#### Alternating Current

An electric current that periodically reverses direction, typically in a sinusoidal waveform.

* Abbreviation: AC

#### Admittance

A measure of how easily a circuit or component allows current to flow, equal to the inverse of impedance.

#### Bandwidth

#### Blooms Taxonomy

A hierarchical model used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity.

We use Blooms Taxonomy to encourage generative AI to create high-quality lesson plans.

It is divided into three domains:

1. cognitive (knowledge-based)
2. affective (emotion-based)
3. and psychomotor (action-based)

In the cognitive domain, the taxonomy is often depicted as a pyramid with six levels, ranging from basic knowledge recall to higher-order skills such as evaluation and creation. These levels, in ascending order, are:

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

**Example:** A teacher designing a lesson plan on circuits might use Bloom's Taxonomy to structure activities, starting with "Remember" (e.g., recalling Ohm's Law) and progressing to "Create" (e.g., designing a complex circuit).

#### Capacitor

A passive electrical component that stores energy in an electric field, characterized by its capacitance measured in farads (F).

#### CircuiTikZ

A [LaTeX](#latex) extension package which provides a set of macros for typesetting electrical and electronic networks.  You simply specify a
component type, a grid placement and some connections and CircuiTikZ
will transform this into a high-quality circuit diagram.

CircuiTikZ is pronounced "Circuit Ticks".

#### Frequently Asked Question

A Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) is a commonly raised inquiry about a specific topic, usually compiled in a list, with the goal of providing clear and accessible answers. FAQs help address recurring concerns or misunderstandings and streamline communication by preemptively answering common questions.

**Example:** In a circuits course, analyzing FAQs can help instructors determine which topics need additional emphasis or clarification. If a majority of FAQs revolve around "How to calculate total resistance in a parallel circuit?", this indicates that students are struggling with that concept, and the instructor might prioritize additional lessons, examples, or tutorials on parallel circuits to improve understanding.

In this course, we use a variety of LLM and statistical tools such as log-file access and search logs to find out what the most frequently asked questions are.

#### GraphRAG

GraphRAG is particularly effective in applications requiring the synthesis of complex, interconnected information, such as knowledge graphs, semantic networks, and relational databases. GraphRAG facilitates more nuanced and informed generation by utilizing the underlying graph-structured information during the retrieval process, enabling more sophisticated and contextually appropriate outcomes in areas like natural language processing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence-driven applications.

In our circuits course, we combine retrieval of similar concepts from our circuits knowledge graph with generative AI to create customized artifacts such as lesson plans and custom circuits.

#### Ground

In the context of educational content generation, hyperpersonalization adapts lessons, materials, and assessments based on the unique needs, performance, and preferences of each student, enhancing the learning process.

**Example:** If a student in a circuits course struggles with questions on "series circuits" in a prior week's quiz, hyperpersonalization can automatically generate a custom lesson plan focusing on this topic. The lesson could include targeted tutorials, interactive simulations, and additional practice problems that address the student's specific areas of difficulty, ensuring more focused and effective learning.

**Example:** In a circuits course, "Ohm's Law" can be a Knowledge Graph Concept, with dependencies on related concepts like "Voltage," "Current," and "Resistance." For instance, understanding Ohm's Law requires knowledge of these three concepts and how they are mathematically related: Voltage = Current × Resistance. Similarly, concepts like "Series Circuit" and "Parallel Circuit" could also depend on understanding Ohm's Law to determine total resistance and current behavior.

#### Laplace Transform

#### Large-language model

A Large-language model (LLM) is an advanced machine learning model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate natural language. In the context of generative AI, LLMs are capable of producing human-like text, answering questions, summarizing information, and assisting in various search and content creation tasks by leveraging patterns learned from their training data.

**Example:** In a circuits course, an LLM can be used to create personalized learning experiences by generating tailored explanations for students based on their questions. For instance, if a student asks, "How does a capacitor work in an AC circuit?", the LLM can generate a detailed response, offer diagrams, and even suggest further reading based on the student's current understanding. This enhances the learning process by providing real-time, adaptive feedback.

#### Pareto Analysis

Pareto Analysis is a decision-making technique used to prioritize tasks or issues based on the principle that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. It focuses on identifying the most significant factors in a dataset to optimize resources and efforts.

**Example:** In a circuits course, Pareto Analysis can be applied to FAQs by categorizing the types of questions students frequently ask. For instance, if 80% of the questions come from 20% of the topics---such as Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and Thevenin's Theorem---the instructor could prioritize creating additional resources or tutorials on those key topics to address the majority of student inquiries efficiently.

**Example:** In our circuits course, a vector store can be used to store vector representations of key concepts or questions from course materials. When a student searches for "how to solve for voltage in a parallel circuit," the system can retrieve similar items, such as related questions on current, resistance, or Kirchhoff's Laws, even if the exact terms are not matched. This helps students find conceptually similar resources or FAQs that are most relevant to their queries.
