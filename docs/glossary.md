#### AC (Alternating Current)

An electric current that periodically reverses direction, typically in a sinusoidal waveform.

#### Admittance

A measure of how easily a circuit or component allows current to flow, equal to the inverse of impedance.

#### Bandwidth

#### Capacitor

A passive electrical component that stores energy in an electric field, characterized by its capacitance measured in farads (F).

#### Current

The flow of electric charge through a conductor, measured in amperes (A).

#### DC (Direct Current)

An electric current flowing in one constant direction, without periodic reversal.

#### Diode

A semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction only, exhibiting low resistance in one direction and high resistance in the opposite.

#### Fourier Transform

A mathematical transformation that converts a time-domain function into its frequency-domain representation, revealing the frequency components present in a signal.

#### Frequency

The number of cycles per unit time of a periodic waveform, measured in hertz (Hz).

#### Impedance

The total opposition a circuit presents to alternating current, comprising both resistance and reactance, measured in ohms (Ω).

#### Inductor

A passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it, characterized by its inductance measured in henrys (H).

#### Kirchhoff's Current Law

A principle stating that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node equals zero, implying conservation of electric charge at a junction.

#### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

A principle stating that the algebraic sum of voltages around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero, reflecting energy conservation.

#### Laplace Transform

A mathematical transformation that converts a time-domain function into a complex frequency-domain function, simplifying the analysis of linear time-invariant systems.

#### Mesh Analysis

A circuit analysis technique using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to determine unknown currents in the meshes (loops) of a planar circuit.

#### Node

A point in a circuit where two or more components are connected.

#### Nodal Analysis

A circuit analysis method using Kirchhoff's Current Law to determine the voltage at various nodes relative to a common reference point.

#### Ohm's Law

A fundamental relationship stating that the voltage across a conductor equals the product of the current flowing through it and its resistance (V = IR).

#### Operational Amplifier

A high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with differential inputs and usually a single-ended output, used in various signal processing applications.

#### Parallel Circuit

A circuit configuration where components share the same voltage across them but may carry different currents.

#### Phasor

A complex number representing the magnitude and phase angle of a sinusoidal function, used to simplify calculations in AC circuit analysis.

#### Power

The rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted, measured in watts (W).

#### Reactance

The opposition a circuit element offers to alternating current due to its capacitance or inductance, causing a phase shift between voltage and current.

#### Resistor

A passive electrical component that opposes the flow of electric current, characterized by its resistance measured in ohms (Ω).

#### Series Circuit

A circuit configuration where components are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows sequentially through each component.

#### Signal

A function representing the variation of a physical quantity over time or space, conveying information.

#### Steady-State Response

The behavior of a circuit long after an input has been applied, when transient effects have subsided and the response becomes constant or periodic.

#### Superposition

A principle stating that in a linear circuit with multiple sources, the total response equals the sum of the responses caused by each source acting independently.

#### Thevenin's Theorem

A theorem stating that any linear bilateral circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a single voltage source and a series resistance connected to a load.

#### Transformer

An electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction, typically changing voltage levels.

#### Transient Response

The behavior of a circuit immediately after a change in its inputs or conditions, before reaching steady-state.

#### Transfer Function

A mathematical representation of the relationship between the input and output of a system, typically expressed in the frequency domain.

#### Voltage

The electric potential difference between two points, driving current through a circuit, measured in volts (V).

#### Watt

The unit of power in the International System of Units, equal to one joule per second (1 W = 1 J/s).
