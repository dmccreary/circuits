## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates a complete circuit with a battery, switch, and light bulb. When the switch is closed and the simulation is running, electrons flow through the circuit (shown as animated red circles) and the light bulb glows yellow. This simulation helps students understand the relationship between current flow and light output in an electrical circuit.

Key features:

- Interactive switch control to open/close the circuit
- Light bulb that glows when current flows
- Animated electron flow visualization
- Adjustable speed and spacing controls
- Real-time status indicators for current flow and bulb brightness

### How to Use

1. Click **Start** to begin the simulation
2. Toggle the **Switch** button (or click the switch in the circuit) to control current flow
3. Watch the light bulb turn on when the switch is closed and current flows
4. Adjust **Speed** slider to control electron animation speed
5. Adjust **Spacing** slider to change distance between electrons
6. Click **Reset** to return to default settings

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain how a switch controls current flow in a circuit
- Describe the relationship between current flow and light bulb brightness
- Identify the path of current through a simple circuit
- Predict what happens to the light bulb when the switch is opened or closed

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Elementary to middle school (grades 4-8)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of circuits and electrical components

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Start the simulation with the switch ON. Observe the electrons flowing and the bulb glowing. Then turn the switch OFF. What happens?

2. **Guided Investigation**: Discuss why the light bulb needs current to glow. Ask: "Where does the energy come from? Where does it go?"

3. **Extension Activity**: Compare this simulation to a real flashlight. Identify the battery, switch, and light bulb in a physical flashlight.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why does the light bulb go dark instantly when the switch opens?
- Reflection prompt: What other devices use a switch to control electrical current?
- Demonstrate understanding by tracing the path of current from battery through switch and bulb back to battery
