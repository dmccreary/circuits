## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how to draw resistor symbols in circuit diagrams. Resistors are components that resist the flow of electric current and are represented by a zig-zag pattern in circuit schematics (US/international style). The simulation shows multiple resistors with different resistance values (220Ω, 1KΩ, 10KΩ, 100KΩ) in both horizontal and vertical orientations.

Key features:

- Toggle between horizontal and vertical resistor orientations
- Multiple resistors with labeled values (ohms and kilohms)
- Adjustable line width for the symbol drawing
- Clear visualization of the zig-zag pattern (6 peaks standard)

### How to Use

1. Click **Switch to Vertical** or **Switch to Horizontal** to change resistor orientation
2. Observe the four resistors with their resistance values
3. Adjust the **Line Width** slider to change the thickness of the lines
4. Click **Reset** to return to default settings

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Recognize the resistor symbol in circuit diagrams (zig-zag pattern)
- Understand that resistors limit current flow in circuits
- Read resistance values using standard units (Ω, KΩ, MΩ)
- Draw proper resistor symbols in circuit diagrams

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Middle school to high school (grades 6-10)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of electrical components and Ohm's Law

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Toggle between orientations and observe how the resistor symbol maintains its zig-zag pattern regardless of direction.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Discuss the different resistance values shown. Ask: "Which resistor allows the most current to flow? Which allows the least?"

3. **Extension Activity**: Research the resistor color code and learn how physical resistors are labeled with colored bands.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why is the resistor symbol drawn as a zig-zag pattern?
- Reflection prompt: Where might you find resistors in everyday electronic devices?
- Demonstrate understanding by explaining the relationship between Ω, KΩ, and MΩ units
