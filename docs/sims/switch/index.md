## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how to draw electrical switch symbols in circuit diagrams. The simulation shows switches in both horizontal and vertical orientations, with clear ON and OFF states. When ON (closed), the switch completes the circuit; when OFF (open), the circuit is broken.

Key features:

- Toggle all switches between ON and OFF states
- Both horizontal and vertical switch orientations
- Pairs of switches showing opposite states for comparison
- Clear visual distinction between open and closed positions

### How to Use

1. Click the **Toggle All Switches** button to flip all switches between ON and OFF states
2. Observe the horizontal switches at the top of the canvas
3. Observe the vertical switches on the left side
4. Notice how each pair shows opposite states (when one is ON, the other is OFF)

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Recognize switch symbols in circuit diagrams
- Distinguish between open (OFF) and closed (ON) switch positions
- Understand how switches control circuit completion
- Draw proper switch symbols in both orientations

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Elementary to middle school (grades 4-8)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of circuits and current flow

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Click the toggle button multiple times and observe how the switch positions change. Note the visual difference between open and closed switches.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Ask: "When is the circuit complete? When can current flow through?" Relate switch position to circuit completion.

3. **Extension Activity**: Find examples of switches in everyday life (light switches, power buttons) and discuss their circuit diagrams.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: What happens to current flow when a switch is opened vs. closed?
- Reflection prompt: Why are switches essential in most electrical devices?
- Demonstrate understanding by drawing a simple circuit with a switch in both ON and OFF positions
