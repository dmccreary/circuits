## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how to draw capacitor symbols in circuit diagrams. Capacitors are components that store electrical energy in an electric field between two parallel plates. The simulation shows multiple capacitors with different capacitance values (10μF, 100nF, 1000pF, 47μF) in both horizontal and vertical orientations.

Key features:

- Toggle between horizontal and vertical capacitor orientations
- Multiple capacitors with labeled values (microfarads, nanofarads, picofarads)
- Adjustable line width for the symbol drawing
- Clear visualization of the parallel plate structure

### How to Use

1. Click **Switch to Vertical** or **Switch to Horizontal** to change capacitor orientation
2. Observe the four capacitors with their capacitance values
3. Adjust the **Line Width** slider to change the thickness of the lines
4. Click **Reset** to return to default settings

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Recognize the capacitor symbol in circuit diagrams
- Understand that a capacitor consists of two parallel plates
- Read capacitor values using standard units (μF, nF, pF)
- Draw proper capacitor symbols in circuit diagrams

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Middle school to high school (grades 7-10)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of electrical components

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Toggle between orientations and observe how the capacitor symbol maintains its parallel plate structure.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Discuss the different capacitor values shown. Ask: "Which capacitor stores the most charge? Which stores the least?"

3. **Extension Activity**: Research common applications for capacitors of different sizes (e.g., large capacitors for power supplies, small capacitors for filtering).

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why does a capacitor need two plates separated by a gap?
- Reflection prompt: Where might you find capacitors in everyday electronic devices?
- Demonstrate understanding by explaining the relationship between μF, nF, and pF units
