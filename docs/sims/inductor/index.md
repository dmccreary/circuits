## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how to draw inductor symbols in circuit diagrams. Inductors are components that store energy in a magnetic field created by current flowing through a coil of wire. The simulation shows multiple inductors with different inductance values (10mH, 1H, 100μH, 47mH) in both horizontal and vertical orientations.

Key features:

- Toggle between horizontal and vertical inductor orientations
- Multiple inductors with labeled values (henrys, millihenrys, microhenrys)
- Adjustable line width for the symbol drawing
- Clear visualization of the coil/loop structure

### How to Use

1. Click **Switch to Vertical** or **Switch to Horizontal** to change inductor orientation
2. Observe the four inductors with their inductance values
3. Adjust the **Line Width** slider to change the thickness of the lines
4. Click **Reset** to return to default settings

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Recognize the inductor symbol in circuit diagrams (coil/loops)
- Understand that an inductor stores energy in a magnetic field
- Read inductance values using standard units (H, mH, μH)
- Draw proper inductor symbols in circuit diagrams

### Target Audience

- Grade level: High school (grades 9-12)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of magnetism and electrical components

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Toggle between orientations and observe how the inductor symbol maintains its coil structure in both directions.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Discuss the different inductance values shown. Ask: "Which inductor stores the most energy? How does the number of coils relate to inductance?"

3. **Extension Activity**: Research common applications for inductors (filters, transformers, energy storage in switching power supplies).

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why does an inductor symbol look like a coil?
- Reflection prompt: Where might you find inductors in everyday electronic devices?
- Demonstrate understanding by explaining the relationship between H, mH, and μH units
