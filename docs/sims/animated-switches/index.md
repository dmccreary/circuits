## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how electrical switches control current flow in a circuit. The simulation shows a square wire loop with two independent switches - one horizontal (on the top wire) and one vertical (on the right wire). Animated red circles represent electrons flowing through the circuit, visually demonstrating the concept of electric current.

Key features:

- Two independent switches (horizontal and vertical) that can be toggled on/off
- Animated electron flow visualization showing current direction
- Adjustable speed and spacing controls for the electron animation
- Current only flows when BOTH switches are closed (demonstrating series circuit behavior)

### How to Use

1. Click the **Start** button to begin the animation
2. Use the **H-Switch** and **V-Switch** buttons to toggle each switch on/off
3. Click directly on the switches in the circuit to toggle them
4. Adjust the **Speed** slider to control how fast electrons move
5. Adjust the **Spacing** slider to control the distance between electrons
6. Observe that current only flows when both switches are ON

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain how switches control the flow of electric current in a circuit
- Demonstrate that a series circuit requires all switches to be closed for current to flow
- Describe the relationship between electron movement and electric current
- Predict the behavior of a circuit when switches are opened or closed

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Middle school to high school (grades 6-10)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of circuits, conductors, and insulators

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Have students experiment with toggling each switch independently and observe what happens to the electron flow. Ask them to record their observations.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Challenge students to answer: "Why does current stop flowing when only ONE switch is opened?" Guide them to understand series circuit behavior.

3. **Extension Activity**: Ask students to draw a circuit diagram that matches the simulation, labeling the battery (implied), wires, and switches.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: What would happen if the switches were wired in parallel instead of series?
- Reflection prompt: How do light switches in your home work similarly to this simulation?
- Demonstrate mastery by explaining the difference between open and closed circuits
