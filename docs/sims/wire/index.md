## Description

This MicroSim provides a basic demonstration of wire drawing for circuit simulations. Wires are the fundamental connectors in electrical circuits, allowing current to flow between components. This simulation serves as a foundation for more complex circuit visualizations.

Key features:

- Basic wire visualization
- Foundation for animated wire demonstrations
- Template for circuit connection drawings

### How to Use

1. Observe the wire representations on the canvas
2. This MicroSim serves as a template for more complex wire animations
3. See the [Animated Wire MicroSim](../animated-wire/) for electron flow visualization

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand that wires are conductors that connect circuit components
- Recognize wire symbols in circuit diagrams
- Explain the role of wires in completing electrical circuits

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Elementary to middle school (grades 3-6)
- Prerequisites: None - introductory level

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Observe how wires are represented in circuit diagrams as simple lines connecting components.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Discuss what wires are made of (copper, aluminum) and why these materials are used (good conductors).

3. **Extension Activity**: Compare this static wire to the [Animated Wire MicroSim](../animated-wire/) to see how current flows through wires.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why do we use metal wires instead of other materials in circuits?
- Reflection prompt: What happens if a wire breaks in a circuit?
- Demonstrate understanding by explaining the difference between a wire and an insulator
