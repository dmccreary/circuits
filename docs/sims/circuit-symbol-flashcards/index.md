## About This MicroSim

This interactive flashcard trainer helps students learn to identify common circuit schematic symbols used in electrical engineering. The MicroSim features 16 essential symbols organized into four categories: Passive components, Sources, Connections, and Active components.

## Features

- **16 Circuit Symbols**: Resistor (US and EU styles), capacitor, polarized capacitor, inductor, DC/AC voltage sources, current source, dependent sources, ground symbols, wire crossings/junctions, switch, and op-amp
- **Three Learning Modes**:
  - **Learn** (default): Symbol displayed with name underneath - click card for description
  - **Flip**: Classic flashcard - see symbol, flip to reveal name and description
  - **Quiz**: Self-assessment with score tracking
- **Category Filter**: Focus on specific symbol types (Passive, Sources, Connections, Active)
- **Shuffle Function**: Randomize card order for varied practice
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate and spacebar to flip/show description

## How to Use

1. **Learn Mode** (default): Browse symbols with names displayed. Click card to see description.
2. **Flip Mode**: View symbol, then flip to reveal name and description.
3. **Quiz Mode**: Test yourself - identify symbols before revealing answers. Score is tracked.
4. **Change Mode**: Click the mode button to cycle through Learn → Flip → Quiz
5. **Category Filter**: Click the category selector to focus on specific symbol types
6. **Navigation**: Use Prev/Next buttons or arrow keys to move between cards

## Symbols Included

### Passive Components
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resistor (US) | Zigzag pattern - opposes current flow |
| Resistor (EU) | Rectangle - IEC standard symbol |
| Capacitor | Two parallel plates - stores charge |
| Polarized Capacitor | Curved plate indicates negative terminal |
| Inductor | Coiled wire - stores energy in magnetic field |
| Switch (SPST) | Opens and closes circuit path |

### Sources
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DC Voltage Source | Long/short lines - provides constant voltage |
| AC Voltage Source | Circle with sine wave - alternating voltage |
| Current Source | Circle with arrow - provides constant current |
| Dependent Voltage Source | Diamond shape - voltage controlled by circuit variable |
| Dependent Current Source | Diamond with arrow - current controlled by circuit variable |

### Connections
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Earth Ground | Three decreasing lines - safety/power ground |
| Signal Ground | Triangle - circuit reference point |
| Wire Crossing | Wires cross but don't connect |
| Wire Junction | Dot indicates electrical connection |

### Active Components
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Operational Amplifier | Triangle with +/- inputs |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Remember (L1)**: Recall the names of common circuit schematic symbols
2. **Remember (L1)**: Identify circuit components by their schematic symbols
3. **Understand (L2)**: Explain the basic function of each component type

### Suggested Activities

**Individual Practice (10-15 minutes)**

1. Start in **Learn Mode** (default) to browse all 16 symbols with names displayed
2. Click each card to read the description explaining each symbol's function
3. Use the category filter to focus on one category at a time

**Practice Recall (5-10 minutes)**

1. Switch to **Flip Mode** by clicking the mode button
2. Try to recall the name before flipping each card
3. Use Shuffle to randomize the order

**Self-Assessment (5-10 minutes)**

1. Switch to **Quiz Mode** for score tracking
2. Shuffle the cards
3. Try to identify each symbol before flipping
4. Track your score and repeat until achieving 100%

**Classroom Challenge**

1. Students compete to correctly identify the most symbols
2. Teacher displays symbols; first student to correctly name it scores a point
3. Discuss the function of each component as it appears

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of electrical circuits
- Familiarity with voltage, current, and resistance concepts

### Assessment

Students should be able to correctly identify all 16 symbols with at least 90% accuracy before moving on to circuit analysis topics.
