## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how to draw battery symbols in circuit diagrams. It shows batteries with clearly marked positive (+) and negative (-) terminals in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The simulation uses a visual representation with a gold top section (positive terminal) and black bottom section (negative terminal).

Key features:

- Toggle between horizontal and vertical battery orientations
- Multiple batteries displayed for comparison
- Clear positive (+) and negative (-) terminal markings
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### How to Use

1. Click **Switch to Horizontal** or **Switch to Vertical** to change battery orientation
2. Observe the three batteries displayed with their terminal markings
3. Click **Reset** to return to the default vertical orientation
4. Notice how the + and - symbols adjust based on orientation

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the positive and negative terminals of a battery symbol
- Recognize battery symbols in both horizontal and vertical orientations
- Understand that batteries are sources of electrical energy in circuits
- Draw proper battery symbols in circuit diagrams

### Target Audience

- Grade level: Elementary to middle school (grades 4-8)
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of electricity and energy

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Toggle between orientations and observe how the terminal markings remain consistent regardless of orientation.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Ask students: "Which end is positive? Which is negative? How can you tell?"

3. **Extension Activity**: Have students draw their own circuit diagrams including properly oriented battery symbols.

### Assessment

- Discussion question: Why is it important to correctly identify positive and negative terminals?
- Reflection prompt: What happens if you connect a battery backwards in a circuit?
- Demonstrate understanding by drawing a battery symbol with labeled terminals
