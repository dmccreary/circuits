# Transient Analysis of RC and RL Circuits

## Summary

This chapter analyzes the time-domain behavior of first-order circuits containing resistors with either capacitors (RC) or inductors (RL). Students will learn how these circuits respond to sudden changes like switching events, developing intuition for time constants and exponential responses. The chapter covers charging and discharging behavior, initial and final conditions, and the concepts of natural and forced response. Understanding transient analysis is crucial for analyzing real-world circuits where signals change over time.
