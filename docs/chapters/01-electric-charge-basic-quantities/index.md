# Electric Charge and Basic Circuit Quantities

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental electrical quantities that form the foundation of all circuit analysis. Students will learn about electric charge, voltage, current, power, and resistance - the essential building blocks for understanding how electrical circuits work. The chapter also covers basic circuit terminology including nodes, branches, and the concept of electrical ground. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to identify and define the core quantities measured in electrical systems and understand the SI units used throughout the course.
