# AC Power Analysis

## Summary

This chapter examines power in AC circuits, which behaves quite differently from DC power due to the phase relationships between voltage and current. Students will learn about instantaneous, average, real, reactive, and apparent power, and understand how power factor affects energy efficiency. The chapter covers the power triangle, power factor correction using capacitors, and power calculations in resistive, capacitive, and inductive elements. Understanding AC power is crucial for audio amplifier design and power system efficiency.
