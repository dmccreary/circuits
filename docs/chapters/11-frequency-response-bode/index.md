# Frequency Response and Bode Plots

## Summary

This chapter introduces frequency response analysis, which characterizes how circuits behave across different frequencies. Students will learn to create and interpret Bode plots showing magnitude and phase response, understand cutoff frequencies and bandwidth, and use asymptotic approximations for rapid analysis. The chapter covers transfer functions and the poles and zeros that determine circuit behavior. Frequency response analysis is essential for designing filters and understanding amplifier bandwidth limitations.
