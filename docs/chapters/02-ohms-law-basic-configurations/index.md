# Ohm's Law and Basic Circuit Configurations

## Summary

This chapter covers Ohm's Law, the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance, and introduces the basic circuit configurations used throughout electrical engineering. Students will learn about voltage and current sources, series and parallel circuit arrangements, and how to use voltage and current dividers to analyze circuits. The chapter also introduces resistor properties including color codes, tolerance, and power ratings. After completing this chapter, students will be able to analyze simple resistive circuits and select appropriate components for basic applications.
