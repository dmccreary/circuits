# Second-Order Circuits and RLC Behavior

## Summary

This chapter extends transient analysis to second-order circuits containing resistors, inductors, and capacitors (RLC). Students will learn how these circuits can exhibit oscillatory behavior and how the damping ratio determines whether the response is overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped. The chapter introduces the natural frequency concept and analyzes both series and parallel RLC configurations. Understanding second-order systems prepares students for analyzing resonant circuits and filters.
