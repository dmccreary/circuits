# Phasors and Complex Impedance

## Summary

This chapter introduces phasors - rotating vectors that elegantly represent sinusoidal signals - and shows how they transform differential equations into algebraic ones. Students will learn about impedance, the AC equivalent of resistance, and how capacitors and inductors create frequency-dependent reactance. The chapter covers the impedance triangle, admittance, and the phasor domain approach to AC circuit analysis. Mastering phasor techniques is essential for efficient analysis of AC circuits.
