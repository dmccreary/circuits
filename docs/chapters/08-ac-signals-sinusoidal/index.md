# AC Signals and Sinusoidal Waveforms

## Summary

This chapter introduces alternating current (AC) and the sinusoidal waveforms that are fundamental to power systems and signal processing. Students will learn to characterize sinusoids by their amplitude, frequency, period, and phase, and understand the relationships between these parameters. The chapter covers important measurement quantities including peak, peak-to-peak, RMS, and average values. Complex numbers are introduced as the mathematical foundation for phasor analysis in the next chapter.
