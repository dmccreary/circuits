# Filters and Resonance

## Summary

This chapter provides practical coverage of filter circuits used in audio and signal processing applications. Students will learn to design first and second-order filters using RC, RL, and RLC configurations, understand filter specifications like order and roll-off rate, and apply these concepts to audio tone control circuits. The chapter covers both passive filters using only RLC components and introduces active filters using operational amplifiers. By the end, students will be able to design filters to meet specific frequency response requirements.
