# DC Circuit Analysis Methods

## Summary

This chapter covers advanced circuit analysis techniques including Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, which allow complex circuits to be simplified to equivalent forms. Students will learn source transformation, the maximum power transfer theorem, and how to analyze two-port networks. The chapter also addresses practical considerations like input and output resistance and the loading effect. After completing this chapter, students will be able to simplify complex circuits, design for maximum power transfer, and understand how connecting circuits together affects their behavior.
