# Audio Applications and Amplifiers

## Summary

This chapter focuses on audio-specific circuit applications, bringing together concepts from throughout the course. Students will learn about audio amplifier types including preamplifiers for low-level signals and power amplifiers for driving speakers. The chapter addresses critical audio quality metrics including signal-to-noise ratio, noise sources, and various forms of distortion. Understanding these concepts enables students to design and evaluate audio circuits that meet professional quality standards.
