# Signal Analysis and Fourier Series

## Summary

This chapter introduces Fourier series analysis, a powerful mathematical tool for understanding the frequency content of periodic signals. Students will learn how any periodic waveform can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids at harmonic frequencies, and how waveform symmetry affects which harmonics are present. The chapter covers the spectrum representation of signals, connecting time-domain waveforms to their frequency-domain content. Understanding Fourier analysis is essential for analyzing audio signals and designing filters to process them.
