## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is designed with a careful progression where each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters. The learning graph ensures that all prerequisite concepts are introduced before they are needed. Students should complete chapters in order, as later chapters assume mastery of earlier material. Each chapter includes interactive simulations and hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts.
