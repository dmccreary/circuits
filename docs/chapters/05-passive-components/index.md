# Passive Components: Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors

## Summary

This chapter provides an in-depth examination of passive electronic components beyond basic resistors. Students will learn how capacitors store energy in electric fields and how inductors store energy in magnetic fields. The chapter covers series and parallel combinations of capacitors and inductors, mutual inductance between inductors, and the practical considerations of real versus ideal components. Understanding these energy storage elements is essential for analyzing dynamic circuits and filters in subsequent chapters.
