It also makes it easy to customize every example and to ask questions about how to analyze a circuit.</p> <p>We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded in all our circuit design and simulation tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.</p> <p>The key skill we teach is how is to be able to provide precise prompts to large-language models (LLMs) to quickly customize your learning journey.</p>"},{"location":"about/#our-new-assumptions","title":"Our New Assumptions","text":"<p>This course will make a new set of assumptions:</p>"},{"location":"about/#1-universal-access","title":"1.

A good example of this is creating embeddings using Ollama Embeddings that run in under 1 GB of RAM.</p> <p>The trick to making smaller models work well is to provide ultra-high quality prompts that traverse graphs to include the appropriate contextual knowledge in the prompts.

The voltage across the capacitor reflects the amount of charge stored relative to its capacity to store charge (capacitance).</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationship with Current:</p> <ul> <li>Current Flow: When current flows into the capacitor, it accumulates charge on the plates, increasing the voltage across it.</li> <li>Accumulated Charge: The total charge accumulated over time affects the voltage. This accumulation is essentially the sum of all the small amounts of charge added over time.</li> <li> <p>Dependence on Capacitance:</p> </li> <li> <p>Capacitance (CCC): This is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store charge per unit voltage. A larger capacitance means the capacitor can store more charge for the same voltage.</p> </li> <li>Effect on Voltage: For a given amount of accumulated charge, a capacitor with a larger capacitance will have a lower voltage across it compared to one with a smaller capacitance.</li> <li> <p>Initial Conditions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Starting Voltage: If the capacitor already has an initial voltage at the starting time (often denoted as t0t_0t0\u200b), this initial voltage must be considered in determining the voltage at a later time.</p> </li> <li>Continuity: The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously; it changes gradually as the charge accumulates or dissipates over time.</li> <li> <p>Time Dependency:</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration Over Time: To find the voltage at a specific time, you consider all the current that has flowed into the capacitor from the starting time to that specific time.</p> </li> <li>Sum of Contributions: Each small interval of current flow contributes to the total charge, and thus the voltage, at the time you're interested in.</li> <li> <p>Practical Interpretation:</p> </li> <li> <p>Charging: When you apply a current to a capacitor, the voltage rises as the capacitor charges up.</p> </li> <li>Discharging: If the current is flowing out of the capacitor (negative current), the voltage decreases as the capacitor discharges.</li> <li>Circuit
