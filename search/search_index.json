Generative AI has changed this.</p> <p>Generative AI make it easy to create a new simulation of a circuit. It also makes it easy to customize every example and to ask questions about how to analyze a circuit.</p> <p>We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded in all our circuit design and simulation tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.</p> <p>The key skill we teach is how is to be able to provide precise prompts to large-language models (LLMs) to quickly customize your learning journey.</p>"},{"location":"about/#our-new-assumptions","title":"Our New Assumptions","text":"<p>This course will make a new set of assumptions:</p>"},{"location":"about/#1-universal-access","title":"1.

Generative AI is not only a great way to create new MicroSims, but given an example microsim template it is excellent at customizing MicroSims.  We provide an extensive collection of templates that can be quickly customized and added to a our library and we encourage others to publish their MicroSims.</p> <p>An example of a course that created MicroSims for electrical engineering courses can be found here. This course was part of the University of Minnesota Senior Seminar in 2024. We are grateful to Sharat Batra for enabling this senior seminar group.</p>"},{"location":"about/#4-metaphors-and-stories","title":"4. Metaphors and Stories","text":"<p>Although many students have a strong math background, some students have difficulty getting an intuitive sense of a circuit from an equation. Fear not!

Using high-quality metaphors and stories makes circuits accessible to a larger population of students that are at different stages of their math journey.</p> <p>Here is a suggested prompt for generating metaphors and stories.  I encourage everyone, both instructors and students to use generative AI to generate non-technical explanations without over dependance on complex mathematical formulas.</p> <p>This gets to the heart of one the key values of this content: making knowledge more accessible to a wider audience regardless of location, race, class or income.</p>"},{"location":"about/#5-faq-analytics","title":"5.

Experienced instructors know this and have developed great tools to give students clear answers to important foundational concepts.</p> <p>However, newer instructors my not have a sense of what key concepts need to be understood and in what order they should be explained. They also don't have a deep understanding of why having an intuitive understanding of key concepts is so essential.  They also have developed ways of listening to students and asking clarifying questions to uncover where the lack of foundational concept understanding lies.</p> <p>Here is where generative AI can help.  Large-language foundation models are trained not ust on a single textbook, but they have learned from literally billions of source documents.  They have a sense of the order these concepts should be taught and the techniques use to teach them.</p> <p>In this course focus on high-quality material for these frequently-asked questions.  This is our Parato Analysis method.  We can use Google Analytics to gather data on  which pages are being used the most and we can use feedback forms to quickly gather feedback when concepts are not clear.</p> <p>This reflects the value that a great course is not just the work of dedicated instructors.

Concept Knowledge Graphs","text":"<p>All circuits courses are based on learning a collection of Concepts that have dependencies on other concepts.

We can traverse this knowledge graph to create precise hallucination-free responses to frequently asked questions.</p> <p>There are many types of knowledge graphs.  The knowledge graph for an entire college course contains around 10,000 concepts.

The voltage across the capacitor reflects the amount of charge stored relative to its capacity to store charge (capacitance).</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationship with Current:</p> <ul> <li>Current Flow: When current flows into the capacitor, it accumulates charge on the plates, increasing the voltage across it.</li> <li>Accumulated Charge: The total charge accumulated over time affects the voltage. This accumulation is essentially the sum of all the small amounts of charge added over time.</li> <li> <p>Dependence on Capacitance:</p> </li> <li> <p>Capacitance (CCC): This is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store charge per unit voltage. A larger capacitance means the capacitor can store more charge for the same voltage.</p> </li> <li>Effect on Voltage: For a given amount of accumulated charge, a capacitor with a larger capacitance will have a lower voltage across it compared to one with a smaller capacitance.</li> <li> <p>Initial Conditions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Starting Voltage: If the capacitor already has an initial voltage at the starting time (often denoted as t0t_0t0\u200b), this initial voltage must be considered in determining the voltage at a later time.</p> </li> <li>Continuity: The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously; it changes gradually as the charge accumulates or dissipates over time.</li> <li> <p>Time Dependency:</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration Over Time: To find the voltage at a specific

rises as the capacitor charges up.</p> </li> <li>Discharging: If the current is flowing out of the capacitor (negative current), the voltage decreases as the capacitor discharges.</li> <li>Circuit
