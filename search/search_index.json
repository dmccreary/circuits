This is a work in progress!</p> <p>Here is what we have learned.</p> <ol> <li>There are extensive image processing libraries that can't be installed with just pip.  You will need to run a tool like brew on the Mac to get the libraries installed.</li> <li>Even after <code>brew</code> installs the libraries, you have to get your environment to find the libraries.  The only way I could get that to work was to set up a local UNIX environment variable.</li> </ol> <p>Here is the brew command that I ran:</p> <pre><code>brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib\n</code></pre> <p>I then had to add the following to my ~/.zshrc file:</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib\n</code></pre> <p>Note that I am running on a Mac with Apple silicon.  This means that the image libraries that brew downloads must be specific to the Mac Arm instruction set.</p> <ul> <li>Cover images for blog post #4364</li> <li>Discussion on overriding the Social Card Image</li> </ul>"},{"location":"license/","title":"Creative Commons License","text":"<p>All content in this repository is governed by the following license agreement:</p>"},{"location":"license/#license-type","title":"License Type","text":"<p>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED)</p>"},{"location":"license/#link-to-license-agreement","title":"Link to License Agreement","text":"<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en</p>"},{"location":"license/#your-rights","title":"Your Rights","text":"<p>You are free to:</p> <ul> <li>Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format</li> <li>Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material</li> </ul> <p>The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.</p>"},{"location":"license/#restrictions","title":"Restrictions","text":"<ul> <li>Attribution \u2014 You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.

The voltage across the capacitor reflects the amount of charge stored relative to its capacity to store charge (capacitance).</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationship with Current:</p> <ul> <li>Current Flow: When current flows into the capacitor, it accumulates charge on the plates, increasing the voltage across it.</li> <li>Accumulated Charge: The total charge accumulated over time affects the voltage. This accumulation is essentially the sum of all the small amounts of charge added over time.</li> <li> <p>Dependence on Capacitance:</p> </li> <li> <p>Capacitance (CCC): This is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store charge per unit voltage. A larger capacitance means the capacitor can store more charge for the same voltage.</p> </li> <li>Effect on Voltage: For a given amount of accumulated charge, a capacitor with a larger capacitance will have a lower voltage across it compared to one with a smaller capacitance.</li> <li> <p>Initial Conditions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Starting Voltage: If the capacitor already has an initial voltage at the starting time (often denoted as t0t_0t0\u200b), this initial voltage must be considered in determining the voltage at a later time.</p> </li> <li>Continuity: The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously; it changes gradually as the charge accumulates or dissipates over time.</li> <li> <p>Time Dependency:</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration Over Time: To find the voltage at a specific time, you consider all the current that has flowed into the capacitor from the starting time to that specific time.</p> </li> <li>Sum of Contributions: Each small interval of current flow contributes to the total charge, and thus the voltage, at the time you're interested in.</li> <li> <p>Practical Interpretation:</p> </li> <li> <p>Charging: When you apply a current to a capacitor, the voltage rises as the capacitor charges up.</p> </li> <li>Discharging: If the current is flowing out of the capacitor (negative current), the voltage decreases as the capacitor discharges.</li> <li>Circuit
