Static textbooks are obsolete.  Learning with hands-on interactive simulations is a lot more fun and effective. In the past, creating these simulations was a slow and expensive process.  Generative AI has changed this.</p> <p>Generative AI make it easy to create a new simulation of a circuit. It also makes it easy to customize every example and to ask questions about how to analyze a circuit.</p> <p>We are entering a new era, where generative AI will be eventually be embedded in all our circuit design and simulation tools.  For example, today the Mermaid drawing program can take a description of a circuit and generate a diagram.</p> <p>The key skill we teach is how is to be able to provide precise prompts to large-language models (LLMs) to quickly customize your learning journey.</p>"},{"location":"about/#our-new-assumptions","title":"Our New Assumptions","text":"<p>This course will make a new set of assumptions:</p>"},{"location":"about/#1-universal-access","title":"1. Universal Access","text":"<p>All teachers and students should have access to LLM tools like ChatGPT or Llama so they can quickly customize a lesson, a simulation or a diagram.  Our goal is to make it easy for all stakeholders to leverage even small LLMs that run on local commodity GPUs.</p> <p>We also provide suggestions on leveraging small models that have been optimized to run on older GPUs with as little as 12GB RAM.  A good example of this is creating embeddings using Ollama Embeddings that run in under 1 GB of RAM.</p> <p>The trick to making smaller models work well is to provide ultra-high quality prompts that traverse graphs to include the appropriate contextual knowledge in the prompts.  We call this approach [The GraphRAG Approach]</p>"},{"location":"about/#2-prompt-engineering","title":"2.

MicroSims","text":"<p>This course leverages the concept of a MicroSim, which are small standalone simulations that illustrate specific concepts.  Generative AI is not only a great way to create new MicroSims, but given an example microsim template it is excellent at customizing MicroSims.  We provide an extensive collection of templates that can be quickly customized and added to a our library and we encourage others to publish their MicroSims.</p> <p>An example of a course that created MicroSims for electrical engineering courses can be found here.

Using high-quality metaphors and stories makes circuits accessible to a larger population of students that are at different stages of their math journey.</p> <p>Here is a suggested prompt for generating metaphors and stories.  I encourage everyone, both instructors and students to use generative AI to generate non-technical explanations without over dependance on complex mathematical formulas.</p> <p>This gets to the heart of one the key values of this content: making knowledge more accessible to a wider audience regardless of location, race, class or income.</p>"},{"location":"about/#5-faq-analytics","title":"5. FAQ Analytics","text":"<p>There are some questions that get answered frequently.  Experienced instructors know this and have developed great tools to give students clear answers to important foundational concepts.</p> <p>However, newer instructors my not have a sense of what key concepts need to be understood and in what order they should be explained. They also don't have a deep understanding of why having an intuitive understanding of key concepts is so essential.  They also have developed ways of listening to students and asking clarifying questions to uncover where the lack of foundational concept understanding lies.</p> <p>Here is where generative AI can help.  Large-language foundation models are trained not ust on a single textbook, but they have learned from literally billions of source documents.  They have a sense of the order these concepts should be taught and the techniques use to teach them.</p> <p>In this course focus on high-quality material for these frequently-asked questions.  This is our Parato Analysis method.  We can use Google Analytics to gather data on  which pages are being used the most and we can use feedback forms to quickly gather feedback when concepts are not clear.</p> <p>This reflects the value that a great course is not just the work of dedicated instructors.

We can traverse this knowledge graph to create precise hallucination-free responses to frequently asked questions.</p> <p>There are many types of knowledge graphs.  The knowledge graph for an entire college course contains around 10,000 concepts.

Charge is a fundamental property of matter, just like mass, but instead of telling you how much \"stuff\" something has, charge tells you how that stuff will interact electromagnetically.</p> <p>Here's the key insight: there are exactly two types of charge, which we creatively call positive and negative. (Benjamin Franklin made this naming choice in the 1750s, and we've been stuck with it ever since. Thanks, Ben.) Opposite charges attract, like charges repel. Simple as that.</p> <p>The fundamental unit of charge is the coulomb (C), named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who spent a lot of time measuring forces between charged objects so you wouldn't have to. One coulomb is actually a huge amount of charge\u2014roughly 6.24 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2078 electrons worth. In practical circuits, we usually deal with much smaller quantities like microcoulombs (\u03bcC) or nanocoulombs (nC).</p> Prefix Symbol Multiplier Example mega M 10\u2076 1 MC = 1,000,000 C kilo k 10\u00b3 1 kC = 1,000 C milli m 10\u207b\u00b3 1 mC = 0.001 C micro \u03bc 10\u207b\u2076 1 \u03bcC = 0.000001 C nano n 10\u207b\u2079 1 nC = 0.000000001 C pico p 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 1 pC = 0.000000000001 C <p>The Electron's Charge</p> <p>A single electron carries a charge of approximately \\(-1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\) coulombs.

This is called drift velocity. So why does your light turn on instantly when you flip the switch? Because you're not waiting for specific electrons to arrive; you're waiting for the electromagnetic field to propagate, which happens at nearly the speed of light.

So increasing R increases damping, while increasing L or C changes both \u03b1 and \u03c9\u2080.</p> 2. A series RLC circuit has R = 100\u03a9, L = 10mH, and C = 1\u03bcF. Calculate \u03c9\u2080, \u03b1, and \u03b6.

Why is critical damping often preferred in practical applications despite not being the 'fastest' in all senses? <p>Critical damping provides the fastest return to equilibrium without overshoot. While an underdamped system might initially reach the target faster, it then overshoots and oscillates before settling.</p> <p>Critical damping is preferred when: - Overshoot could cause damage (mechanical systems hitting limits) - False readings are unacceptable (measuring instruments) - Oscillation could trigger unwanted events (digital circuits) - Smooth motion is required (camera stabilization)</p> <p>The \"fastest\" actually depends on what you're optimizing.

Why are active filters preferred over passive LC filters at audio frequencies? <p>Several practical reasons favor active filters for audio:</p> <ol> <li> <p>No inductors: At audio frequencies (20 Hz - 20 kHz), inductors would need to be very large (henries!) and expensive. Capacitors and op-amps are much cheaper and smaller.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gain is possible: Active filters can amplify the signal while filtering, eliminating the need for separate amplifier stages.</p> </li> <li> <p>No loading issues: Op-amp buffers provide high input impedance and low output impedance, so cascading multiple filter stages doesn't change their individual responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Q easily achieved: Getting high Q with passive RLC requires either very large L or very small R, both problematic. Active filters achieve high Q with just RC components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjustability: Active filter parameters can be made adjustable with potentiometers without complex switching.</p> </li> </ol> 4.

A square wave has only odd harmonics. Why don't even harmonics appear? <p>Square waves have half-wave symmetry: f(t + T/2) = -f(t)</p> <p>This means the second half of each period is the exact negative of the first half. Mathematically, when you compute the Fourier coefficients for even harmonics (n = 2, 4, 6...), the integral over one period cancels to zero because of this symmetry.</p> <p>Physically, even harmonics would add constructively in the first half and destructively in the second half, violating the required symmetry.</p> 3. Why does a triangle wave have fewer high-frequency components than a square wave? <p>Triangle waves are smoother\u2014they have continuous first derivatives (no sudden jumps or corners). High-frequency harmonics are needed to create sharp transitions in the time domain.</p> <p>Quantitatively: - Square wave harmonics decay as 1/n - Triangle wave harmonics decay as 1/n\u00b2</p> <p>So the 9th harmonic is: - Square: 1/9 \u2248 11% of fundamental - Triangle: 1/81 \u2248 1.2% of fundamental</p> <p>The faster decay means high harmonics contribute much less to the triangle wave.</p> 4. If you low-pass filter a square wave, what happens to its shape? <p>A low-pass filter attenuates high-frequency components. For a square wave:</p> <ol> <li>Mild filtering (cutoff above 5th harmonic): Corners become slightly rounded</li> <li>Moderate filtering (cutoff around 3rd harmonic): Significant rounding, overshoot may appear</li> <li>Heavy filtering (cutoff below fundamental): Approaches a sine wave</li> </ol> <p>The sharp corners of a square wave require high harmonics.

Why should you use a 10X probe instead of 1X for most oscilloscope measurements? <p>The 10X probe has several advantages:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Higher input impedance (10 M\u03a9 vs 1 M\u03a9): Less loading on the circuit</p> </li> <li> <p>Lower input capacitance (~10 pF vs ~100 pF): Less distortion of fast edges</p> </li> <li> <p>Higher bandwidth: Typically 200-500 MHz vs 10-20 MHz</p> </li> <li> <p>Better noise immunity: Higher impedance reduces pickup</p> </li> </ol> <p>The only disadvantage is a 10\u00d7 reduction in displayed signal, making very small signals harder to see. For signals above ~10 mV, the 10X probe is almost always the better choice.</p> 2. Your oscilloscope shows a slowly drifting waveform instead of a stable display. What control should you adjust? <p>The trigger level needs adjustment.</p> <p>The trigger level must cross the waveform consistently for stable display. If it's set too high or too low (outside the waveform range), the scope won't find valid trigger points and the display will drift.</p> <p>Also check: - Trigger source is correct channel - Trigger mode is Auto or Normal - Trigger edge matches the waveform transition you want</p> 3. When measuring the output voltage of a sensor with 100 k\u03a9 source impedance, your 10 M\u03a9 multimeter reads 4.95V. What is the actual sensor voltage? <p>The measured voltage is reduced by the voltage divider formed by source and meter impedance:</p> \\[V_{measured} = V_{actual} \\times \\frac{R_{meter}}{R_{meter} + R_{source}}\\] \\[4.95 = V_{actual} \\times \\frac{10M}{10M + 0.1M}\\] \\[4.95 = V_{actual} \\times 0.99\\] \\[V_{actual} = \\frac{4.95}{0.99} = 5.00 \\text{ V}\\] <p>The loading error is only 1% in this case because the meter impedance is 100\u00d7 the source impedance.</p> 4. Your breadboard circuit oscillates unexpectedly. What might be causing this and how would you fix it? <p>Common causes of unexpected oscillation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Positive feedback: Check for wiring errors that create feedback paths</p> </li> <li> <p>Parasitic capacitance: Breadboard capacitance can cause high-frequency instability. Add small capacitors (0.1 \u03bcF) across IC power pins.</p> </li> <li> <p>Long leads: Create inductance that can oscillate with circuit capacitance. Shorten leads and keep wires flat.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ground bounce: Insufficient grounding causes voltage fluctuations. Use multiple ground connections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power supply instability: Ripple or noise on supply can cause oscillation. Add bypass capacitors.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Fixes: Add bypass caps, shorten leads, improve grounding, reduce stray coupling between input and output.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/16-laboratory-techniques/#summary_1","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Laboratory skills transform theoretical knowledge into practical ability:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Master your multimeter - Voltage in parallel, current in series, resistance with power off</p> </li> <li> <p>The oscilloscope is your eyes - Learn time base, vertical sensitivity, and triggering</p> </li> <li> <p>Function generators have 50\u03a9 output - Account for this when connecting to circuits</p> </li> <li> <p>Use 10X probes by default - Higher impedance, lower capacitance, wider bandwidth</p> </li> <li> <p>Compensate your probes - Uncompensated probes distort square waves</p> </li> <li> <p>Triggering stabilizes the display - Set level, source, and edge correctly</p> </li> <li> <p>AC coupling removes DC - Useful for small AC on large DC levels</p> </li> <li> <p>Breadboards have limitations - High frequency and high current don't work well</p> </li> <li> <p>Loading affects measurements - High-impedance sources require high-impedance meters</p> </li> <li> <p>Safety first, always - Power off before connecting, respect voltage hazards</p> </li> </ol> <p>These practical skills take time to develop, but they're what separate theoretical understanding from real engineering capability.

The voltage across the capacitor reflects the amount of charge stored relative to its capacity to store charge (capacitance).</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationship with Current:</p> <ul> <li>Current Flow: When current flows into the capacitor, it accumulates charge on the plates, increasing the voltage across it.</li> <li>Accumulated Charge: The total charge accumulated over time affects the voltage. This accumulation is essentially the sum of all the small amounts of charge added over time.</li> <li> <p>Dependence on Capacitance:</p> </li> <li> <p>Capacitance (CCC): This is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store charge per unit voltage.

will have a lower voltage across it compared to one with a smaller capacitance.</li> <li> <p>Initial Conditions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Starting Voltage: If the capacitor already has an initial voltage at the starting time (often denoted as t0t_0t0\u200b), this initial voltage must be considered in determining the voltage at a later time.</p> </li> <li>Continuity: The voltage across a capacitor cannot
